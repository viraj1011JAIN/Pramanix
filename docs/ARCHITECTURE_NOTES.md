## Subsystem Details

### Guard (`guard.py`)

**Owns:** The verification orchestration pipeline. Instantiated once per Policy type at application startup.

**Construction-time work:**
1. `policy.validate()` — raises `PolicyError` / `InvariantLabelError` immediately on bad policy definition.
2. Pydantic model extraction from `Policy.Meta`.
3. SHA-256 policy fingerprint computation (`_compute_policy_fingerprint`). If `GuardConfig.expected_policy_hash` is set and mismatches, raises `ConfigurationError` — catches silent policy drift across replicas.
4. `WorkerPool` spawn for `async-thread` / `async-process` modes.
5. `FastPathEvaluator` construction if `fast_path_enabled=True`.
6. Expression tree pre-compilation via `transpiler.compile_policy`.

**`verify()` pipeline (in order):**
```
1. Pydantic strict-mode validation (intent + state)
2. Fast-path O(1) pre-screen (if enabled) — can only BLOCK
3. Translator consensus extraction (if translator_enabled=True)
4. guard_pipeline semantic post-consensus check
5. Z3 solve via solver.py
6. Decision construction
7. Ed25519 signing (_sign_decision)
8. Audit sink emit (all configured sinks, failures caught and logged)
9. Structlog emission
10. OTel span close (if otel extra installed)
11. Prometheus counter/histogram update (if prometheus extra installed)
12. ResolverRegistry.clear_cache() in finally block
```

**Boundary:** `Guard.verify()` **never raises**. Every exception — including unexpected ones from user-defined `invariants()` — is caught and returned as `Decision.error()` with `allowed=False`. `Decision(allowed=True)` is never returned from any error handler.

**Failure model:**
- Pydantic validation failure → `Decision(status=VALIDATION_FAILURE, allowed=False)`
- Z3 timeout → `Decision(status=TIMEOUT, allowed=False)`
- Z3 exception → `Decision(status=ERROR, allowed=False)`
- Worker crash (async-process) → `Decision(status=ERROR, allowed=False)`
- Signing failure → `Decision(status=ERROR, allowed=False)` (not an unsigned decision)
- Sink failure → logged, decision already returned to caller

---

### GuardConfig (`guard_config.py`)

**Owns:** Immutable configuration dataclass for Guard. Environment variable ingestion (`PRAMANIX_*` prefix). Prometheus counter/histogram initialisation. OTel `_span()` context manager. Structlog secrets-redaction processor.

**`__post_init__` validates (raises `ConfigurationError`):**
- `solver_timeout_ms > 0`
- `max_workers > 0`
- `execution_mode` in `{"sync", "async-thread", "async-process"}`
- `solver_rlimit >= 0`
- `max_input_bytes >= 0`
- `max_input_chars > 0`
- `min_response_ms >= 0.0`
- `injection_threshold` in `(0.0, 1.0]`
- `consensus_strictness` in `{"semantic", "strict"}`
- `injection_scorer_path` exists if set
- `shed_worker_pct` in `(0.0, 100.0]`
- `shed_latency_threshold_ms > 0.0`

**`__post_init__` emits `UserWarning` (does not raise):**
- `metrics_enabled=True` without `prometheus_client` installed
- `otel_enabled=True` without `opentelemetry-sdk` installed
- `execution_mode` in `{"sync", "async-thread"}` with `PRAMANIX_ENV=production`
- `signer=None` with `PRAMANIX_ENV=production`
- `audit_sinks=()` with `PRAMANIX_ENV=production`
- `solver_rlimit=0` with `PRAMANIX_ENV=production`
- `max_input_bytes=0` with `PRAMANIX_ENV=production`

**Boundary:** GuardConfig is a frozen dataclass (immutable after construction). All env-var reading happens at construction time.

---

### Policy (`policy.py`)

**Owns:** Base class combining field schema, invariants, and Meta. The only authoring surface users subclass.

**Three parts a subclass provides:**
1. Class-level `Field(name, python_type, z3_sort)` attributes — typed schema
2. `invariants()` classmethod — returns `list[ConstraintExpr]`, each `.named(label)`
3. Optional inner `Meta` class with `version`, `semver`, `intent_model`, `state_model`

**Boundary:** Policy classes are passed as class references (not instances) to Guard. They cross process boundaries via pickle (class reference only — no Z3 objects). `Policy.validate()` is called by Guard at construction time and raises immediately on empty invariants or duplicate/missing labels.

---

### DSL / Expressions (`expressions.py`)

**Owns:** The Python-level constraint DSL. Field descriptors, `E()` expression builder, `ConstraintExpr`, `ForAll`, `Exists`, `ArrayField`, `DatetimeField`, `NestedField`.

**Boundary:** Pure Python — zero Z3 imports. The transpiler is the sole site that converts DSL nodes to Z3 AST. No `eval`, `exec`, or `ast.parse` is used anywhere.

---

### Transpiler (`transpiler.py`)

**Owns:** DSL AST → Z3 AST lowering. This is the only file in the codebase that calls `z3.*` from DSL nodes.

**Design invariants:**
- Floats are never passed to Z3 directly. Every float goes through `Decimal(str(v)).as_integer_ratio()` to get an exact rational.
- Integer literals default to `z3.RealVal` for compatibility with Real-sorted fields.
- `InvariantASTCache` (`compile_policy`) pre-walks the expression tree at Guard construction time and caches field references and metadata. This eliminates repeated tree walks at request time.

**Boundary:** Called only by `solver.py` (and `Guard.__init__` for pre-compilation). Never called by user code.

---

### Solver (`solver.py`)

**Owns:** Z3 invocation. Two-phase verification strategy.

**Phase 1 (fast path, all-invariants):**
- One shared `z3.Solver` with all invariants added via `add()`.
- If result is `sat` → return SAFE immediately. This is the common case.
- If result is `unsat` → proceed to Phase 2.

**Phase 2 (attribution, per-invariant):**
- Each invariant gets its own `z3.Solver` with `assert_and_track`. One assertion per solver so `unsat_core()` is always `{label}` — complete violation attribution, no minimal-core ambiguity.

**Failure model:**
- `z3.unknown` (timeout) on either phase → `SolverTimeoutError` with the invariant label. Caught by Guard, returned as `Decision(status=TIMEOUT)`.
- Every Z3 instance has `set("timeout", timeout_ms)` applied. If `solver_rlimit > 0`, `set("rlimit", solver_rlimit)` is also applied.

**Boundary:** Internal module (`__all__ = []`). Called only by `guard.py`.

---

### Worker (`worker.py`)

**Owns:** Async execution modes. Thread pool (`async-thread`) and process pool (`async-process`).

**Critical invariants:**
1. No Z3 objects cross the process boundary. Workers receive `(policy_cls, values_dict, timeout_ms)` and reconstruct the formula tree inside the child.
2. `policy_cls` is a class reference — picklable via its fully-qualified import name.
3. Decision counter is a plain `int` in the host process, guarded by `threading.Lock`. Zero IPC.
4. Stalled-process recycle: the old executor is handed to a daemon background thread. `_drain_executor` waits `_RECYCLE_GRACE_S` seconds then force-kills surviving processes. The event loop is never blocked.

**Failure model:**
- Worker crash → `Decision.error()` returned to caller. Fail-closed.
- Worker pool `shed` (load-shedding) when P99 latency exceeds threshold → `Decision.block()` returned. Never `allowed=True`.

---

### Fast Path (`fast_path.py`)

**Owns:** O(1) Python pre-screen before Z3.

**Invariants (enforced in code, not just comments):**
- Fast-path rules can only BLOCK — they return a string reason or `None`.
- Only Z3 can produce `Decision(allowed=True)`.
- A fast-path BLOCK means Z3 is not invoked at all.
- A fast-path PASS means Z3 is invoked normally.
- Runs after Pydantic validation, before Z3.

**Target:** < 0.1 ms per request. False positive rate: 0% (no legitimate requests blocked).

---

### Decision (`decision.py`)

**Owns:** The immutable, JSON-serialisable result type.

**Invariant enforced in `__post_init__`:** `allowed=True ↔ status=SAFE`. No other combination is valid.

**Status values:**
| Status | allowed | Cause |
|---|---|---|
| `SAFE` | `True` | Z3 proved all invariants hold |
| `UNSAFE` | `False` | Z3 found a counterexample |
| `TIMEOUT` | `False` | Z3 exceeded time budget |
| `ERROR` | `False` | Unexpected internal error |
| `STALE_STATE` | `False` | `state_version` field mismatch |
| `VALIDATION_FAILURE` | `False` | Pydantic model validation failed |
| `CONSENSUS_FAILURE` | `False` | Dual-model LLM consensus disagreement |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | `False` | Load-shedding threshold exceeded |
| `CACHE_HIT` | `False` | Reserved; not currently returned by Guard |

**Canonical hash (`decision_hash`):** SHA-256 over `decision_id + status + allowed + violated_invariants + explanation`. Computed via `orjson` (or stdlib `json` if orjson not installed). Deterministic regardless of key ordering.

---

### Audit (`audit/`)

**Owns:** Cryptographic tamper detection and batch provability.

**Components:**
- `DecisionSigner` — signs `decision.decision_hash` with Ed25519 (via `PramanixSigner`). Called by Guard for every decision if a signer is configured.
- `DecisionVerifier` — verifies Ed25519 signature offline using public key only.
- `MerkleAnchor` — in-memory Merkle tree. `add(decision_id)` → `root()` → `prove(decision_id)` → `proof.verify()`. Proves any single decision was part of an unaltered batch without replaying all decisions.
- `PersistentMerkleAnchor` — same API + `checkpoint_callback` every N additions.
- `MerkleArchiver` — bulk export and pruning of anchored batches.

**Boundary:** Signing failure in `Guard._sign_decision()` returns `Decision.error()` rather than an unsigned decision. The audit trail never silently contains unsigned records.

---

### Crypto (`crypto.py`)

**Owns:** Ed25519 key pair management and sign/verify for Decision objects.

**Key lifecycle:** Old public keys must be archived. Decision records embed `public_key_id` so historical signatures remain verifiable after rotation. `PramanixSigner.generate()` creates a new ephemeral key pair (warns on stderr in production). Production deployments should use `KeyProvider`.

**Dependency:** `cryptography` package (optional extra `crypto`). If not installed, `PramanixSigner` is unavailable. Guard works without signing but emits `UserWarning` in production.

---

### Key Provider (`key_provider.py`)

**Owns:** `KeyProvider` protocol and all implementations. Abstracts key sourcing from `PramanixSigner`.

**Built-in (no extra deps):** `PemKeyProvider`, `EnvKeyProvider`, `FileKeyProvider`

**Cloud (require extras):**
- `AwsKmsKeyProvider` — AWS Secrets Manager (`pip install 'pramanix[aws]'`)
- `AzureKeyVaultKeyProvider` — Azure Key Vault (`pip install 'pramanix[azure]'`)
- `GcpKmsKeyProvider` — GCP Secret Manager (`pip install 'pramanix[gcp]'`)
- `HashiCorpVaultKeyProvider` — HashiCorp Vault KV v2 (`pip install 'pramanix[vault]'`)

**Testability:** All cloud providers accept an injected `_client` parameter so tests can mock the cloud SDK without real credentials.

---

### Execution Token (`execution_token.py`)

**Owns:** HMAC-SHA256 single-use token that closes the TOCTOU gap between `Guard.verify()` and execution.

**Problem it solves:** Without tokens, a replayed or stolen `Decision(allowed=True)` could trigger the guarded action without a fresh verification.

**Token contents:** `decision_id`, `intent_dump`, `policy_hash`, `expires_at` (default 30 s), `token_id` (per-mint nonce), `signature` (HMAC-SHA256 over canonical body).

**Single-use guarantee:** `ExecutionTokenVerifier.consume()` checks signature + expiry + removes `token_id` from an in-memory set under `threading.Lock`. A token can be consumed exactly once.

**Gap:** The consumed-set is in-memory only. A process restart clears it — replay is possible if a token was minted before restart and consumed after. `RedisExecutionTokenVerifier` closes this for Redis deployments. See `KNOWN_GAPS.md § 1`.

---

### Audit Sinks (`audit_sink.py`)

**Owns:** `AuditSink` protocol and all built-in implementations.

**Protocol:** `emit(decision: Decision) -> None`. Must not raise. Implementations catch all exceptions internally.

**Built-in:** `StdoutAuditSink`, `InMemoryAuditSink`

**Enterprise (require extras):** `KafkaAuditSink` (`kafka`), `S3AuditSink` (`s3`/`aws`), `SplunkHecAuditSink` (`splunk`), `DatadogAuditSink` (`datadog`)

**Failure model:** Sink failures are caught by Guard and logged via structlog. They never propagate to the caller and never affect the returned Decision.

---

### Circuit Breaker (`circuit_breaker.py`)

**Owns:** Adaptive fail-closed circuit breaker protecting the Z3 solver under load.

**State machine:**
```
CLOSED → OPEN (pressure detected) → HALF_OPEN (probe) → CLOSED (recovery)
3 consecutive OPEN episodes → ISOLATED (requires manual reset())
```

**Invariant:** Always fail-closed. `ALLOW_WITH_AUDIT` is a deprecated alias for `BLOCK_ALL` — it emits `DeprecationWarning` at construction time. The circuit breaker never returns `allowed=True` without a successful Z3 solve.

---

### Resolver Registry (`resolvers.py`)

**Owns:** Lazy field resolution with per-request context isolation.

**Problem it solves:** In async servers (FastAPI/Uvicorn), concurrent requests share an OS thread. `threading.local` would let Task B see Task A's resolved values (P0 data-bleed). `contextvars.ContextVar` is Task-scoped under asyncio and thread-scoped under threading — each request owns an independent cache namespace.

**Invariant:** Guard calls `ResolverRegistry.clear_cache()` in its `finally` block after every `verify()` call. No resolved value survives across requests.

---

### Translator (`translator/`)

**Owns:** LLM intent extraction with 5-layer prompt injection defence.

**5 layers (in order):**
1. Unicode NFKC normalisation (`_sanitise.py`) — collapses homoglyphs
2. Input length enforcement (`InputTooLongError` at `max_input_chars`)
3. Control-character stripping
4. Injection pattern detection (regex, `_INJECTION_RE`)
5. Dual-model consensus (`redundant.py`) — two LLMs must agree before any result is used

**Dual-model consensus (`extract_with_consensus`):** Calls two translators concurrently. Both results are validated against the intent Pydantic schema. If they disagree on required fields, raises `ExtractionMismatchError`. Agreement modes: `strict_keys` (default), `lenient`, `unanimous`.

**Injection scorer (`injection_scorer.py`):** `BuiltinScorer` wraps the heuristic. `CalibratedScorer` requires scikit-learn and must be trained on labelled examples. Scorer path configurable via `GuardConfig.injection_scorer_path`.

**Status:** Beta. Requires two LLM API keys for full protection. See `KNOWN_GAPS.md § 7`.

---

### Platform Check (`_platform.py`)

**Owns:** Import-time compatibility validation.

**What it checks:** Presence of `/lib/ld-musl-*.so.1` (Alpine Linux / musl libc). Z3 ships glibc-compiled wheels that segfault or run 3–10× slower on musl.

**When it runs:** Once at `import pramanix.guard` (before any Guard construction).

**Bypass:** `PRAMANIX_SKIP_MUSL_CHECK=1`. If you set this on Alpine, Z3 segfaults are your problem.

---

### CLI (`cli.py`)

**Commands:**
- `verify-proof` — offline Ed25519 signature verification
- `audit verify` — replay and verify a Merkle proof
- `simulate` — dry-run a policy against a JSON payload
- `policy migrate` — apply a PolicyMigration to a state JSON file
- `schema export` — dump Policy JSON schema
- `calibrate-injection` — train a CalibratedScorer on a labelled JSONL dataset
- `doctor` — 10-check environment diagnostic. Exits 0 if clean. `--json` for machine-readable output. `--strict` to fail on warnings.

---

### Primitives (`primitives/`)

**Owns:** Pre-built Policy base classes covering common domains. Users `invariant_mixin` these into their own policies.

**Modules:** `fintech.py`, `healthcare.py`, `finance.py`, `rbac.py`, `time.py`, `infra.py`, `common.py`

These are library code — they define invariants but own no state and make no external calls.

---

### Integrations (`integrations/`)

**Owns:** Thin adapter layers for external frameworks.

**Coverage:** FastAPI, LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGen, CrewAI, DSPy, Haystack, Pydantic AI, Semantic Kernel (the last five are stubs — see `KNOWN_GAPS.md § 8`).

**Boundary:** Adapters call `Guard.verify()`. They do not contain policy logic. All policy enforcement happens inside Guard.

---

### IFC — Information-Flow Control (`ifc/`)

**Owns:** Lattice-based information-flow enforcement between trust levels.

**Components:**

- `FlowPolicy` — defines `FlowRule` entries mapping `(source_label, dest_label)` pairs to `ALLOW` or `DENY`. Rules are evaluated in declaration order; first match wins.
- `FlowEnforcer` — evaluates a `ClassifiedData` object against a `FlowPolicy`. Returns `FlowDecision`.
- `TrustLabel` — string-typed enum of security classification levels (e.g. `"PUBLIC"`, `"CONFIDENTIAL"`, `"SECRET"`, `"REGULATED"`).

**`regulated()` preset rules (explicit):**

- `REGULATED → INTERNAL`: `permitted=False` — regulated data must not flow to internal systems.
- `REGULATED → CUSTOMER`: `permitted=False` — regulated data must not flow to customer-facing sinks. Explicit rule; violation reason surfaced in `FlowViolationError`.
- `REGULATED → CONFIDENTIAL`: `permitted=False` — regulated data must not flow to confidential sinks. Explicit rule; violation reason surfaced in `FlowViolationError`.

Previously, `REGULATED → CUSTOMER` and `REGULATED → CONFIDENTIAL` fell through to `default_deny=True` without a matching rule, producing a generic "no rule matched" error with no diagnostic context.

**Bounded audit log:** `FlowEnforcer` accepts `max_audit_log_size: int = 10_000` at construction. The internal audit log is capped at this size with LRU eviction (`list.pop(0)`). Without this cap, a long-running service enforcing high-frequency flows would grow the log without bound.

**Boundary:** `FlowEnforcer` operates independently of `Guard`. It is the caller's responsibility to consult `FlowEnforcer` before allowing data to cross a trust boundary. No automatic coupling to `Guard.verify()` exists.

**Status:** Beta. No integration tests with Guard. See `KNOWN_GAPS.md § 13`.

---

### Privilege Separation (`privilege/`)

**Owns:** Tool capability manifests and execution scope enforcement.

**Components:**
- `CapabilityManifest` — declares which `ToolCapability` entries an agent is permitted to invoke.
- `ExecutionScope` — a frozen set of permitted capabilities for one execution context.
- `ScopeEnforcer` — raises `PrivilegeEscalationError` if a tool invocation is not in scope.

**Boundary:** `ScopeEnforcer.enforce()` must be called at the point of tool invocation. It is not called by Guard automatically.

**Status:** Beta. No integration tests with Guard. See `KNOWN_GAPS.md § 13`.

---

### Human Oversight (`oversight/`)

**Owns:** Approval workflows for actions that require a human decision before execution.

**Components:**
- `ApprovalWorkflow` — `@runtime_checkable` Protocol. Defines the interface all workflow backends must implement: `request_approval()`, `approve()`, `reject()`, `check()`, `records()`. Custom backends (Slack, PagerDuty, JIRA) implement this and are `isinstance()`-testable at runtime.
- `InMemoryApprovalWorkflow` — in-process reference implementation. Stores pending `ApprovalRequest` objects in a `threading.Lock`-guarded dict. `approve()` / `reject()` write an HMAC-signed `OversightRecord` to the audit trail.
- `EscalationQueue` — thread-safe, TTL-aware queue of pending approval requests sorted oldest-first.
- `OversightRecord` — HMAC-signed record of the approval decision and approver identity. `__slots__` restricts attribute injection. `verify()` checks the HMAC tag in-process; it does not protect against memory tampering by the host process.

**Background sweeper:** `InMemoryApprovalWorkflow` starts a daemon thread (`pramanix-oversight-sweeper`) at construction time. The thread calls `expire_stale()` + `_auto_reject()` on a configurable interval (`sweep_interval_s=60.0`). Expired requests are recorded with `ApprovalStatus.TIMEOUT`. `stop_sweeper()` sets a `threading.Event` that the sweep loop checks and joins the thread.

**Idempotent auto-rejection:** `_auto_reject()` checks `if req.request_id in self._decisions: return` under the workflow lock before writing. A concurrent `check()` call and the sweeper can both trigger `_auto_reject()` for the same request; only the first write lands.

**`OversightRecord` HMAC signing:** Uses `hmac.HMAC(key, data, hashlib.sha256)` over a deterministic serialisation of `(request_id, action, status, reviewer_id)`. The signing key defaults to `os.urandom(32)` per workflow instance. This provides tamper detection within a single process instance — audit records from different instances cannot be cross-verified without a shared signing key.

**Boundary:** `OversightRequiredError` is raised when an action reaches the oversight gate without a valid approval. Guard does not consult the oversight subsystem — callers must wire it in.

**Status:** Beta. In-memory only. No persistence. No integration tests. See `KNOWN_GAPS.md § 13`.

---

### Secure Memory (`memory/`)

**Owns:** Scoped, access-controlled memory partitions for agent state.

**Components:**
- `SecureMemoryStore` — root store. Creates and manages `ScopedMemoryPartition` instances.
- `ScopedMemoryPartition` — isolated key-value namespace. Cross-partition reads raise `MemoryViolationError`.
- `MemoryEntry` — typed, timestamped entry with a `classification` label.

**Boundary:** Partitions are isolated by label at the application level. No OS-level memory protection. Serialisation to disk is not implemented — store contents are lost on process exit.

**Status:** Beta. No integration tests. See `KNOWN_GAPS.md § 13`.

---

### Policy Lifecycle (`lifecycle/`)

**Owns:** Policy version diffing and shadow evaluation.

**Components:**
- `PolicyDiff` — compares two Policy versions and produces `FieldChange` and `InvariantChange` records.
- `ShadowEvaluator` — runs a new policy version in shadow (no-op) mode alongside the current version. Returns `ShadowResult` with both decisions for comparison.

**Boundary:** `ShadowEvaluator` does not affect the Guard's actual decision. It runs the shadow policy in a separate `Guard` instance and logs the difference.

**Status:** Beta. No integration tests against real rolling deployments. See `KNOWN_GAPS.md § 13`.

---

### Provenance (`provenance.py`)

**Owns:** Chain-of-custody records for agent actions.

**Components:**
- `ProvenanceRecord` — immutable record of one agent action: `agent_id`, `action`, `inputs`, `decision_id`, `timestamp`.
- `ProvenanceChain` — ordered list of `ProvenanceRecord` entries with append-only semantics. `verify_chain()` checks hash-linking between consecutive records.

**Boundary:** The chain is in-memory. Persistence is the caller's responsibility.

**Status:** Beta. Hash-linking verified in unit tests. No end-to-end tests under concurrent write load. See `KNOWN_GAPS.md § 13`.

---

### Identity (`identity/`)

**Owns:** Zero-trust JWT identity linking. Maps a verified JWT `sub` claim to application state via a pluggable `StateLoader`.

**Security properties of `JWTIdentityLinker._verify_token()`:**

1. **Algorithm pinned before signature.** Header is decoded first. If `alg != "HS256"`, `JWTVerificationError` is raised immediately — before any signature computation. Prevents algorithm-confusion attacks (CVE-2015-9235 family).
2. **Signature verified before claims.** HMAC-SHA256 over `header_b64.payload_b64` is compared via `hmac.compare_digest`. Payload JSON is not parsed until after the signature check passes.
3. **`exp` enforced** with configurable clock skew (`self._skew`).
4. **`nbf` enforced** with the same skew. Tokens not yet valid are rejected.
5. **Non-empty `sub` required.** `"sub": ""` or absent `sub` raises `JWTVerificationError`. An empty `sub` maps to a Redis key of `""` which is attacker-controlled.
6. **Caller state ignored.** State is loaded exclusively via the verified `sub` through `StateLoader.load(claims)`. Request-body state is never used.

**Boundary:** `JWTIdentityLinker` is not called by `Guard` automatically. The caller extracts the JWT from the `Authorization` header, calls `linker.extract_and_load(request)`, and passes the returned state dict into `guard.verify_async(intent=..., state=state)`.

---

## Cross-Cutting Invariants

1. `Guard.verify()` never raises. Always returns `Decision`.
2. `Decision(allowed=True)` only when `status=SAFE`. Enforced in `Decision.__post_init__`.
3. Audit sinks never propagate failures to callers.
4. The fast path can only BLOCK, never ALLOW.
5. No Z3 objects cross process boundaries.
6. Resolver cache is cleared after every `verify()` call.
7. Structlog secrets-redaction processor runs before any renderer — secrets never reach disk.
8. Policy fingerprint mismatch on Guard construction raises `ConfigurationError` — no silent drift.
9. Alpine/musl is rejected at import time unless explicitly bypassed.
10. HMAC-sealed IPC: worker results in `async-process` mode are tagged with an ephemeral key. The host verifies the tag before trusting `allowed`. A forged `allowed=True` from a compromised worker requires knowledge of the in-process ephemeral key.
11. `ConstraintExpr.__bool__` raises `PolicyCompilationError` — accidental `and`/`or` in a policy is caught at compile time, not silently mis-evaluated.
12. `min_response_ms` timing pad is applied unconditionally to both ALLOW and BLOCK — not just BLOCK — to prevent timing oracle attacks.
13. `JWTIdentityLinker` validates `alg` header before signature computation — algorithm confusion is impossible without subverting the pinning check.
14. `PramanixKafkaConsumer.safe_poll()` continues on transient `msg.error()` — a single `_PARTITION_EOF` does not terminate the poll loop.
15. `InMemoryApprovalWorkflow._auto_reject()` is idempotent under concurrent calls — concurrent sweeper and `check()` cannot produce duplicate `OversightRecord` entries for the same request.

---
